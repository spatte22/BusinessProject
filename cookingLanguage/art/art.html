&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have more than 15 years of teaching experience. When I first started private tutoring I was in my second year of university. I realized very soon how important art was for my students, especially when I started to teach primary school children.<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a teacher to an afternoon private school I had to make sure that all of my students would improve their academic grades, pay attention, and study for the next day. The lessons would take place every afternoon at 3 PM. For a child that, that is essentially extra school after school, which sounds impossible. It took me a while to come up with ideas and solutions in order to achieve better grades, a better environment, and of course motivate my students into participating after a long day of school. When I started implementing art & crafts into my curriculum, all of my students changed their behavior towards studying almost immediately; they couldn't wait to have an art project, which became their reward.<br /><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introducing art projects regularly with a combination of educational games was something that relaxed the kids and promoted team spirit, self-respect, and respect of others. Overall, every one of my students became more receptive to math, history, language, and school in general!
