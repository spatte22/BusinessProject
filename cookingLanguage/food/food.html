<div class="text">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I studied classical Philology at the University of Patras, specializing in linguistics. For the first two years I engaged extensively with classical writers and poets in Ancient Greek and Latin. I analyzed The Iliad and The Odyssey in three different dialects of the Greek language: Modern Greek, Koine, and Ancient Greek. I dealt extensively with the fathers of history, Herodotus and Thucydides, introducing me to one of my favorite works, "The Peleponnesian War". I believe that "The Peloponnesian War" by Thucydides is one of the most important and timeless works of history and of the Western world in general. I believe it must be taught in every country and in every language. In the process of studying, I was attracted to linguistics and the commonalities of language. Languages ​​from the same language-family are subject to the same grammar and syntax rules. I love historical linguistics, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, neurolinguistics, and so forth - the list truly is endless.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I finished my studies, I started working as a teacher through private tutoring. I received at-home language lessons from a very young age, therefore private tutoring came very natural to me as a teacher. My private teachers were highly qualified, and advanced my Latin and Ancient Greek level quickly; I strive to make the same impact on my students as my teachers made on me.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with the private lessons I worked for many years in various private afternoon schools. Since lessons took place in the afternoon (after regular school), the children were quite tired and only wanted to play and relax. It was quite difficult at first to understand what the problem was. I soon realize that kids are kids, and one of the few ways to get their attention is through play. So, when I incorporated games and fun activities, their mood changed 180 degrees. I started a lot of different projects with my students. Art and crafts are something that almost all children (without exception) love very much. Every child loves colors and painting - something illustrated beautifully in "The Little Prince" by Antoine de Saint-Exupery.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, in order to inspire my students, I experimented with many different projects: mathematics and symmetry through the eyes of Leonardo da Vinci and the sequence of Fibonacci numbers, physics and chemistry through art projects, and language through the eyes of poetry and translation. Something that helps me adapt to the needs of the lesson is to always have in the back of my mind and not to forget as much as possible what it is like to be a child.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really believe in what is called "lifelong learning", that real education is the constant effort for self-improvement. What I truly ask of my students is that they, themselves, strive to progress and improve on a personal as well as a social level.
